E-Commerce Business Insights Analysis (SQL)
## Project Overview

Businesses generate massive transactional data daily, but without structured analysis, it is difficult to understand what drives revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational performance.

This project analyzes a large Brazilian e-commerce dataset to uncover actionable insights around sales performance, customer behavior, delivery efficiency, and payment trends.

The goal was simple: transform raw data into business intelligence that supports smarter decision-making.

## Business Objectives

Evaluate overall revenue and order performance

Identify top-performing products and categories

Analyze customer purchasing patterns

Measure delivery efficiency

Understand drivers of customer satisfaction

## Tools & Skills Used

SQL (MySQL)

Data Cleaning & Validation

Window Functions

Joins & Aggregations

Business KPI Analysis

Analytical Problem Solving

## Dataset

Public Brazilian e-commerce dataset containing over 100,000 orders, multiple product categories, payment records, delivery timelines, and customer reviews.

## Project Approach
### 1. Data Quality Assessment & Cleaning

Before performing any analysis, the dataset was audited for:

Missing values

Duplicate records

Invalid timestamps

Negative pricing

Inconsistent fields

Duplicates were removed using window functions, and invalid records that could distort revenue and delivery analysis were excluded.

Why this matters: Reliable insights depend on trustworthy data.

### 2. Core Business KPI Analysis

Key metrics were calculated to understand overall performance:

Total Orders

Total Revenue

Total Customers

Average Order Value

Monthly Order Trends

This provided a high-level view of business health and growth patterns.

### 3. Product & Revenue Insights

Analysis identified the products and categories generating the highest sales volume and revenue.

Business Value:
Helps leadership prioritize profitable segments and optimize marketing investment.

### 4. Delivery Performance Analysis

Delivery timelines were evaluated to measure operational efficiency.

Metrics included:

Average delivery duration

Percentage of late deliveries

Business Value:
Delivery speed directly impacts customer experience and retention.

### 5. Customer Satisfaction Drivers

Customer review data was analyzed alongside delivery timelines to understand what influences ratings.

Key Finding: Longer delivery times strongly correlate with lower review scores.

This highlights logistics performance as a critical lever for improving customer satisfaction.

## Key Insights

Revenue is concentrated among a small number of product categories, indicating strong opportunities for targeted growth.

Late deliveries are a major contributor to poor customer reviews.

Faster deliveries consistently lead to higher customer satisfaction.

A small set of payment methods dominates transactions, suggesting opportunities to streamline the checkout experience.

Clean, structured transactional data significantly improves the reliability of operational reporting.

## Business Recommendations

Improve logistics partnerships to reduce delivery delays.

Prioritize high-revenue categories in marketing and inventory planning.

Track delivery SLAs as a core performance metric.

Optimize the checkout process around dominant payment methods.

Implement routine data quality checks to support accurate reporting.

## Project Impact

This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that improve revenue, operations, and customer experience.

## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals that logistics performance plays a critical role in customer satisfaction, with delayed deliveries strongly linked to lower review scores. Additionally, revenue concentration among a small number of categories suggests opportunities for focused growth. By improving delivery speed and prioritizing high-performing segments, the business can drive both customer retention and revenue expansion.
